# Coxeter groups and properness
For finite irreducible Coxeter groups, the notion of _proper_ness for group
elements was introduced in [2012.09749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09749),
and has geometric motivations, as discussed in
[2007.09238](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09238) and
[2104.10101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10101).
This repository stores the proper elements of the finite families
(types E,F,G, and H) of the finite irreducible Coxeter groups.
